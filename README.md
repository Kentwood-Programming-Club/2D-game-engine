This is where you can update changes via Git.

To sync all the file changes for everyone, you can use `commit and push`. To commit you must first `stage` all the changes (you can pick and choose, say youre not ready to commit some files)

To update your workspace wil changes others have made, use `pull`.

Its a good idea to have VSCode and git installed on your computer.
